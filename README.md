# AlvaAR and AR.js Experiments

The aim of this project is to explore [AlvaAR](https://github.com/alanross/AlvaAR) and integrate with location-based [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js), with an eventual aim to place geographic AR content realistically on the ground.

So far, just a proof-of-concept using AlvaAR from an A-Frame component.

## Instructions

Copy the AlvaAR code into the project. This can be done by copying the `assets` directory from the AlvaAR examples [here](https://github.com/alanross/AlvaAR/tree/main/examples/public) into the `public` directory in this repository. 

Build the bundle:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Run from a server in `public`.
